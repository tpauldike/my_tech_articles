# My Techie Son/Daughter
> I need more than a mentee, one is enough but I don't mind having more than one*

It is true that “at any level you are, someone out there is dreaming to get to that level”.

I know that thousands of persons benefit from me or my content in one way or the other; hundreds of persons even
follow closely, including my colleagues and some of the persons I look up to; tens of persons get in touch privately
and remain in touch, and some submit to me for mentorship or guidance, BUT... I want my own Son/Daughter in tech,
one is enough. Even if you know absolutely nothing, I will teach and train you every step of the way; in fact, I am
looking at getting you prepared within 2 years, 2024 - 2026, and we'll kick off in February 2024, no matter how busy
I get. I may not be an expert yet but I invite you to climb this ladder with me now.

## About My Son/Daughter
Let me tell you a bit about that son/daughter of mine; it doesn't matter what country he is from, it has to be someone who:
1. May know little or nothing about tech but is so passionate and fascinated about it.
2. Is not in a hurry to start earning from tech.
3. Is submissive to authority and follows instructions with little or no supervision
4. Is diligent, honest, committed, patient and open-minded
5. Owns a PC, has electricity and has a good internet connection.
